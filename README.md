Source code for paper "Fairness Enhancement of UAV Systems With Hybrid Active-Passive RIS." Part 2: UAV trajectory optimization.

This is the source code for the UAV trajectory optimization in paper N. T. Nguyen, V.-D. Nguyen, Q. Wu, A. Tolli, S. Chatzinotas, and M.Juntti, "Fairness Enhancement of UAV Systems with Hybrid Active-Passive RIS," IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, vol. 23, no. 5, pp. 4379 - 4396, 2023. 
To use this code:
- The code is implemented with YALMIP and MOSEK. Please make sure that you have installed these toolboxes properly before running the code.
- I have already included sample dataset. If you want to generate your own dataset or want to modify the channel model, please look at the file "gen_channel.m"
- Run files start with "main_" to plot figures.

Thank you and if you find the code helpful, please kindly cite this paper in your publication.
